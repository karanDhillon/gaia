# Gaia

A single-activity android project which features jetpack compose, dagger hilt, and navigation done entirely with composables with no fragment present!

> This project is created purely for educational purpose, and would act as a guide to understand the interoperability of all the above mentioned concepts. Project's name inspiration comes from greek mythology 'Gaia - the ancestral mother of all life'.
